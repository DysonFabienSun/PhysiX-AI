## Quick Start
Brief orientation and next steps. Keep this section short and actionable.

- Install prerequisites (Python, Git, editor)
- Clone repo and explore this README
- Optional: browse `docs/` for future page splits

<span id="learning-path"></span>
## Learning Path
High-level sequence for Physical AI. Keep the outline evergreen and details concise.

1. Foundations (math, physics, ML basics)
2. Simulation and modeling
3. Control and optimization
4. Systems and deployment

<span id="tools"></span>
## Tools
Minimal toolchain pointers. Expand later into their own sections or pages.

- Git and GitHub
- Python environment management
- Editors and extensions

<span id="projects-roadmap"></span>
## Projects Roadmap
Short list of planned examples/demos. Link internally where useful, keep most content inline.

- Starter notebooks
- Simulation examples
- Benchmarks

<span id="contribute"></span>
## Contribute
Lightweight guidance for collaborators. Expand as needed.

- Use concise PRs
- Prefer small, incremental edits
- Keep links relative and stable

<span id="faq"></span>
## FAQ
Common questions, brief answers. Use lists for scan-ability.

- Hosting? Not yet; this README is the main entry point.
- Migration to MkDocs? This structure maps directly to `docs/index.md` and a simple `nav`.
